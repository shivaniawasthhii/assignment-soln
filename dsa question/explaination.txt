   availableTickets-available train tickets ,"start city - end city

defined a function 
findTravelRute that will find the travel route starting from Kiev
then initialized an array route with 'Kiev' as the starting point

started while loop that continues until
length of the route array == number of cities son visited .

then will get the last city in the route array
which is the current city the boy are in

then will call the findNextCity function to find the next city based
on the available train tickets.

then will check if nextCity exists ,If nextCity exists
then push it into the route array.
Once the while loop will complete, will return the route array

In each iteration, the code identifies the current city, 
then uses the findNextCity function to determine the 
next city based on available train tickets.
 If a next city exists, it's added to the route array.
Once the loop completes, the route array containing the travel route is returned.
